# 2022-shimada-chlorophyll

Chlorophyll data collected from the Bell M. Shimada during the 2022 International Year of the Salmon

Samples were collected via Niskin bottles at depths of 5, 25, and 75 meters, filtered through Whatman GF/F filters, and frozen at -80 degrees until analysis. Samples were analyzed by extraction in 90% acetone for 12-24 hours, centrifuged, and read with a TD-700 benchtop fluorometer using methods from Parsons et al., 1984.
